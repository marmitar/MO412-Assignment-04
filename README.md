## Caley Trees

Consider Cayley trees T(k,P) as defined in Problem 4 of Barabasi's book Chapter 3 on Random Networks, for k >= 3.

1. Find a formula for the diameter d_max of T(k,P) in terms of k and P.
2. Find a formula for the number of nodes N of T(k,P) in terms of k and P.
3. Does T(k, P) exhibit small world behavior?  To answer that, compute the limit of d_max/(ln N) for fixed k >= 3 and P going to infinity.  If this limit is a constant larger than 0 then, yes, T(k,P) has the small world property.
